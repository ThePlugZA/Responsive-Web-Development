     <h3 id="section-heading">Why The Weeknd?</h3>
  <p>Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, famously known as The Weeknd, is one of the most influential artists of the decade. His music is a mixture of RnB, Hip Hop & Pop with his own personal twist on the genres by the dark subjects his songs are about. What makes his music stick is simply because it is only from the heart and he takes us on a journey where he in his story he is simultanously the protagonist and antagonist. His disography has banked unbelievable numbers during the dacade,proving his consitency.</p>
     <ul>
       <li>His music is used in a theraputic manner. Like simply heals the soul.</li>
       <li>The diversity in his discography is trully astonishing, a song for every mood with no compromise on quality.</li>
     </ul>
